# Autonomous Loop State

Maintained by the autonomous development loop. One entry per iteration.

## Current position

- **Milestone:** M1.1 — Stabilization and UX hardening (in progress)
- **M1 (Local hardware inventory):** complete — 10 steps, commits `34ddc8d`…`0ef3790`,
  DoD verified (unelevated start, CIM → SQLite cache → bridge → React,
  RequiresElevation path, 14 backend tests)

## M1.1 checklist

| Task | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Vitest tests for the bridge client | ✅ this iteration | 9 tests: correlation, concurrent requests, typed errors, timeout, unavailable, subscribe |
| Loading state | ✅ done in M1 | `HardwareInfoPage` LoadState `loading` |
| Readable error state | ✅ done in M1 | Error card with message |
| Requires-elevation state | ✅ done in M1 | `StatusBadge` variant `elevation` on BitLocker card |
| Refresh inventory button | ✅ done in M1 | forceRefresh via bridge |
| Show app version | ⬜ open | needs backend action (system module) + UI placement |
| Show database path | ⬜ open | same system-info surface as version |
| Show log file path | ⬜ open | same system-info surface as version |
| Open logs folder button | ⬜ open | shell-open action; harmless, but document as host-side action |
| README: run instructions + current limitations | 🔶 partial | run instructions exist; limitations section missing |
| Document unelevated behavior + cache verification | 🔶 partial | ADR 0002/0003 cover design; user-facing doc missing |

## Iteration log

### 2026-07-02 — Iteration 1
- Task: add Vitest tests for `bridgeClient.ts`
- Changes: `frontend/package.json` (vitest+jsdom devDeps, `test` script),
  `frontend/vite.config.ts` (vitest config, jsdom environment),
  `frontend/src/shared/bridge/bridgeClient.test.ts` (9 tests)
- Gates: `npm test` 9/9 ✅ · `npm run build` ✅ · `dotnet build` 0 warnings ✅ ·
  `dotnet test` 14/14 ✅
- Next recommended: system-info surface (app version + database path + log path)
  as one vertical slice — new `system/getAppInfo` bridge action + UI footer/panel

## Standing constraints (from loop definition)

- One small task per iteration; finish M1.1 before M2.
- Milestone completion ⇒ stop with NEEDS_USER_REVIEW, do not auto-start next.
- Read-only behavior everywhere until M6; ADR before any architectural change.
